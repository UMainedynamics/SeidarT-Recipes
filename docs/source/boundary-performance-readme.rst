Boundary Performance 
--------------------

Testing the performance of the CPML allows for building optimal models. There are 3 primary parameters - :math:`\kappa`, :math:`\sigma`, and :math:`\alpha` for the absorbing boundary. 


There are different approaches to estimating the reflected power. This script computes the cumulative energy density in the boundary region over the full time interval.
