Composite Radargram
-------------------

There are a few approaches to creating a broadband source and the subsequent multi-modal wavefield. This recipe sums multiple models to achieve that. Alternatively, a multi-modal chirplet can be created with the *sourcefunction* command, however this may not account for frequency specific attenuation and boundary conditions until a set of auxiliary differential equations are implemented.
